# Player Stats Addon

Aggregates character data like /played time and gold values so you can keep track of stats across all your characters.

Usage:

PlayerStats will track the data of any character you load.  If you want to track time played on a character, you'll have to load into the game at least once with them.

/pst time - will show a breakdown and total of all time played
/pst gold - will show the total gold earned on the current realm
/pst help - will show a full list of commands


This is a pretty early build put together so we could answer the question "How much time have i spent in WoW". Updates are planned, and if you have any suggestions feel free to share them with me at aproctor - gmail.  Or on Twitter @aproctor
